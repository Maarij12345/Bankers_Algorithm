# Banker's Algorithm Operating Systems 

This project uses the Banker's Algorithm in C++ to determine whether a system is in a safe state. If the system is safe, it outputs the safe sequence of process execution; otherwise, it indicates that the system is not in a safe state.


## How to Compile and Run

### Linux/Unix
1. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   g++ bankers_algorithm.cpp -o bankers_algorithm
